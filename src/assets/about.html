    <h1>Prague Astronomical Clock Simulator</h1>
    <img id="clock" src="clock.jpg" width="470" height="470" alt="clock face">
    <h2>Graphic design</h2>
    <p>The original SVG clock graphics and font used here were originally developed by Jan Tošovský, as found on
      this <a href="https://drifted.in/horologium-app/" target="_blank">web site</a>.</p>
    <p>The color scheme here has been altered, the graphics have been modified to cover a full range of latitudes,
      and the graphics can now be updated quickly within a web browser, rather than relying on server-based updates.
      A central map, similar to the one featured in the original clock, has been added.</p>

    <h2>Differences between the simulator and the original Prague clock</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The positioning of the simulator’s clock hands, hour dial, sun, moon, and ecliptic wheel are done using
        modern astronomical calculations, rather than simulating the internal gearing of the physical clock.</li>
      <li>The original clock shows a map of the world in the center of the clock face, with the south pole toward the
        top, centered on Prague. The map projection (as best as I can tell) is a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection" target="_blank">stereographic projection</a>,
        which corresponds to the type of projection used in the astrolabe-like design of the entire clock face.<br><br>

        Since this simulation can be set to any location on Earth, not only Prague, the globe image needs to turn and
        rotate rather than being an unchanging painting. The easiest, fastest-rendering way to do this was to use a
        camera-like perspective, rendering the globe as the Earth would be seen at a distance from space. The result
        is a map which is somewhat different than the original map, even when the simulator’s location is set to
        Prague.</li>
      <li>The simulator can operate within the Arctic and Antarctic circles. This lead to the possibility of all-day
        darkness and all-day light. A new region of the clock face, marked “SOL NOCTIS” (Latin for <em>evening sun</em>)
        will appear at these extreme latitudes. The lines of unequal hours can become very narrow, and may be dropped
        altogether.<br><br>

        The time between one sunset and the next is always divided into twenty four hours of
        <a href="https://www.theflorentine.net/2016/03/03/the-duomo-clock/" target="_blank">Bohemian time</a> (aka
        Italian time), even when it days or even months might pass between sunsets.
        </li>
      <li>The simulator can operate in the southern hemisphere. When the latitude is set south of the equator, the
        clock markings and clock hand motion are reversed, becoming counter-clockwise.</li>
    </ul>
