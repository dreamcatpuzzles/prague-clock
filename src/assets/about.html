    <h1>Prague Astronomical Clock Simulator</h1>
    <img id="clock" src="clock.jpg" width="435" height="435" alt="clock face">
    <h2>Animation</h2>
      <p>To see the clock change quickly through time or location changes, click on a digit in the time, longitude,
        or latitude fields, then either click and hold on the associated up/down arrow icons, or use up/down arrow keys,
        and the clock will quickly progress through a series of times or locations.
    <h2>Graphic design</h2>
    <p>The original SVG clock graphics and font used here were originally developed by Jan Tošovský, as found on
      this <a href="https://drifted.in/horologium-app/" target="_blank">web site</a>.</p>
    <p>The color scheme here has been altered, the graphics have been modified to cover a full range of latitudes,
      and the graphics can now be updated quickly within a web browser, rather than relying on server-based updates.
      A central world map, similar to the one featured in the original Prague clock, has been added.</p>

    <h2>Differences between the simulator and the original Prague clock</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The positioning of the simulator’s clock hands, hour dial, sun, moon, and ecliptic wheel are done using
        modern astronomical calculations, rather than simulating the internal gearing of the physical clock.</li>
      <li>The original clock shows a map of the world in the center of the clock face, done using a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection" target="_blank">stereographic projection</a>,
        with the south pole toward the top, centered on Prague. Since this simulation can be set to any location on
        Earth, not only Prague, the map will rotate in order to center on the currently set latitude and longitude.</li>
      <li>The simulator can operate within the Arctic and Antarctic circles. This leads to the possibility of all-day
        darkness and all-day light. A new region of the clock face, marked “SOL NOCTIS” (Latin for <em>evening sun</em>)
        will appear at these extreme latitudes. The lines of unequal hours can become very narrow, and may be dropped
        altogether.</li>
      <li>The time between one sunset and the next is always divided into twenty four hours of
        <a href="https://www.theflorentine.net/2016/03/03/the-duomo-clock/" target="_blank">Bohemian time</a> (aka
        Italian time), even when days or even months might pass between sunsets.
        </li>
      <li>The simulator can operate in the southern hemisphere. When the latitude is set south of the equator, the
        clock markings and clock hand motion are reversed, becoming counter-clockwise.</li>
    </ul>
